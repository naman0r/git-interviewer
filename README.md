# Git Interviewer 🎤  
A pre-commit hook that *interviews you* about your code before letting you commit.

Git Interviewer transforms everyday commits into lightweight technical interviews.  
Before each commit, it analyzes your staged changes, generates interview-style questions, and requires a meaningful answer.  

This forces deeper understanding, intentional commits, and better engineering discipline — but in a fun way.

---

## Why Git Interviewer?

Most developers commit code too quickly:

- without thinking about design decisions  
- without explaining intent  
- without validating risks  
- without reflecting on tradeoffs  

**Git Interviewer slows you down — in a good way.**  
It makes you articulate *why* you wrote the code, not just *what* you wrote.

Think of it as having a senior engineer inside your terminal.

# Features I want to build

### Interview Modes (Personas)
Choose the personality you want challenging your commit:

| Mode      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `nice`    | Supportive engineer who wants clarity and understanding. |
| `grumpy`  | Tired senior dev who has seen too much. Very picky. |
| `systems` | Asks about architecture, scaling, risk, tradeoffs. |
| `founder` | Focuses on product impact and iteration speed. |



If you build this, your repo will be **dramatically** higher quality, and everyone who installs it will become a better engineer.

Feel free to open issues, request new personas, or contribute new interview logic!
